# PolyMc
1.21 build
What if you could put mods on a server, without needing it on the client?  
Well, that's impossible. But we can try! *Nothing is impossible!*

**Note:** if you're a mod developer looking to make a mod that'll be solely used serverside, you might want to consider [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer). It has some advantages and disadvantages over PolyMc.

## How PolyMc works
PolyMc is unique in that it operates on packet level. This means PolyMc doesn't touch the mechanics of the mod at all.
The server is *genuinely modded*. This results in the server being quite stable, all the hacks PolyMc does to display things
are separated from what's actually happening. 

PolyMc uses a host of techniques to automatically try and display your modded things. PolyMc also features a large api
to customize how items/blocks/entities/whatevers are transformed.
